She was strong, graceful, and strikingly beautiful the kind of beauty that wasn’t just skin deep. Her confidence, her poise and the way she carried herself drew eyes wherever she went. People whispered tales about her elegance, her charm and how men from far and wide tried to win her heart. But the princess was no stranger to attention and no stranger to heartbreak either. </p>
